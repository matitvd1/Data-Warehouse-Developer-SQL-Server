Exploring Data Source
- What data types are being usde
- How often is a column null
- How often does a column have small or large value

Incremental ELT Process: many options
- Create one Package for each data source
	* Each package needs to handle the extract, transform and load for that data source
	* Each data source is processed independently
	* Great option:
		* each data source is independent
		* problematic or dynamic data source
- Separate packages for each step (Extract, Transform and Load)
	* Staging database required
	* Great option:
		* little time to laod
		* different data sources requires heavy integration

Extracting Modifed Data
- Datetime column -> Track when was the last time the record was changed. Triggers or stored procedures
- Change Data capture
- Change tracking -> Stores the primary key of changed row. Then it goes to the table and find the row. Can be set to auto clean up
